              <p>
                The <em>I‚ÄëChing</em> (ÊòìÁ∂ì), or <em>Book of Changes</em>, is one
                of the oldest works of wisdom in human history. Originating in
                ancient China more than 3,000 years ago, it has been studied by
                philosophers, poets, rulers, and spiritual seekers across
                centuries. At its heart, the I‚ÄëChing is not about predicting the
                future‚Äîit is a mirror for self‚Äëreflection. It helps us
                understand the patterns of change in life, offering perspective
                on challenges, decisions, and opportunities.

              <p>
                This app provides a modern way to connect with the wisdom of the
                I‚ÄëChing while preserving the spirit of its traditional practice.

                <strong>Set Your Intention</strong>
                <br />
                Before generating a hexagram, take a moment to center yourself
                and form a clear question or reflection. The quality of your
                intention shapes the clarity of the response.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Automatic Random Tosses</strong>
                <br />
                The app simulates traditional coin tosses instantly, using a
                fair random number generator. This method is fast, simple, and
                always available.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Manual Tosses</strong>
                <br />
                For those who enjoy ritual, you can toss real coins yourself and
                input the results into the app. The app then calculates the
                hexagram and provides the interpretation. Detailed instructions
                are included to guide you through the process.

                <strong>Receive Your Hexagram and Interpretation</strong>
                <br />
                Each consultation provides not only the hexagram but also its
                meaning, imagery, and suggested reflections to help you connect
                its wisdom to your life.

                The interpretation provided in this app is generated by a
                state-of-the-art language model,{" "}
                <strong>google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp</strong>. This model has
                been trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and
                generate human-like language. The goal of these AI-generated
                interpretations is to make the readings and hexagram casts more
                digestible and accessible for modern users.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the AI aims to stay true to the spirit of the I‚ÄëChing, it
                is ultimately a modern perspective rather than a traditional
                commentary. For those seeking deeper context, the full text of
                the Wilhelm/Baynes translation is still available within the
                app, allowing you to explore the original imagery, philosophy,
                and wisdom in its entirety.
              </p>

                Use these AI-generated insights as a starting point for your own
                reflection and connection with the text, blending ancient wisdom
                with modern technology to enrich your experience with the
                I‚ÄëChing.

                  How Hexagrams Are Calculated
                </h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                A hexagram is made of six lines, each of which can be either
                broken (yin) or unbroken (yang). Lines are built from the bottom
                up, one by one, through a process of coin tosses. In the
                traditional method, three coins are tossed at once, and the
                values of heads and tails are added to determine whether the
                resulting line is yin or yang. Repeating this process six times
                creates the complete hexagram.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some lines are considered ‚Äúchanging lines,‚Äù which indicate
                transformation. These special lines point to a second hexagram,
                showing how the situation is in motion and may evolve. Thus, an
                I‚ÄëChing reading often presents two hexagrams: the primary one
                describing the current moment, and the transformed one revealing
                the direction of change.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 64 possible hexagrams, each with its own imagery,
                commentary, and philosophical teaching, form the heart of the
                I‚ÄëChing. Consulting the book involves reflecting on how these
                symbolic patterns relate to your question and your life.

                <strong>Computer Randomness</strong>
                <br />
                The app uses a high‚Äëquality random number generator to mimic the
                unpredictability of physical coin tosses. While algorithmic,
                this randomness is unbiased and functions as a valid way to
                consult the I‚ÄëChing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Physical Coin Tosses</strong>
                <br />
                Many practitioners value the tactile ritual of tossing coins.
                The rhythm of the toss, the sound of metal, and the presence of
                chance in the physical world create a meditative atmosphere.
                This embodied process can make the reading feel more alive and
                personal, as your energy and the moment itself become part of
                the divination.

                The I‚ÄëChing does not give simple yes‚Äëor‚Äëno answers. Instead, it
                offers <strong>images, metaphors, and wisdom</strong> that
                encourage reflection. By reading and contemplating the response,
                you may discover new perspectives, inner clarity, or a deeper
                connection with the flow of life.

                This app uses the <strong>Wilhelm/Baynes translation</strong>,
                the most influential and widely read version in the Western
                world. First published by Richard Wilhelm and translated into
                English by Cary F. Baynes, this edition combines scholarship
                with poetic depth. It has inspired countless thinkers and
                writers.

                <strong>Note on Carl Jung‚Äôs Foreword:</strong> The English
                edition includes a landmark foreword by the psychologist Carl
                Gustav Jung, who viewed the I‚ÄëChing as a profound tool for
                engaging with synchronicity‚Äîthe meaningful interplay between
                inner states and outer events. His foreword offers a
                philosophical lens that many readers find illuminating,
                especially when approaching the text as guidance for
                self‚Äëreflection rather than prediction.

                Whether you use the I‚ÄëChing for daily meditation, guidance in
